# Hangman

## Overview
This web application accepts user input and checks it against a randomly generated word to play the classic Hangman game. This application uses pure vanilla JavaScript--and would have been much easier to build with jQuery. 

You may want to grab your local maester or install a Westerosi spell check before attempting to beat [hangman](https://alyssamanse.github.io/Hangman-Game/). 

## Technologies Used
